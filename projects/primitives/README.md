# Primitives – Tabs

A headless, directive-first Tabs primitive for Angular, inspired by Angular CDK
and Angular Primitives.

This library focuses on **behavior and state**, not styling or layout.
It is designed to be composable, explicit, and safe by default.

---

## Philosophy

- No components, only directives
- No global state
- Explicit relationships
- Signals for internal state
- Consumers control markup and styling

Each `<div apTabs>` creates an isolated tabs scope.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @sridhar_natuva/primitives
